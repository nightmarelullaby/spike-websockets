### Socket.IO advantages

- Socket.IO supports multiplexing through namespaces. Making use of namespaces enables you to minimize the number of TCP connections used, and save socket ports on the server. 
    
- Socket.IO allows the server side to flexibly broadcast events to all the connected clients. You can also broadcast events to a subset of clients via the rooms feature.
    
- Socket.IO offers [HTTP long-polling](https://ably.com/topic/long-polling) as a fallback option, which is useful in environments that don't support WebSockets.
    
- Socket.IO provides a configurable Ping/Pong heartbeat mechanism, allowing you to detect if a connection is alive or not. Additionally, if and when a client gets disconnected, it automatically reconnects.
