### What is HTTP protocol?

Fundamentally, HTTP is a communication protocol that enables clients (such as a web browser) and servers to share information.

For example, HTML documents, images, application data (JSON), and more.

### How it works?

When a client does a request, the server sends a response that includes not only the requested content, but also relevant information about the request.

Is important to keep in mind that **after server returns this response to client, the connection between the two ones is closed**.

### It is possible to make a realtime connection only with HTTP?

Short answer: Yes, but is complicated.

This pattern, where the client makes a request and the server issues a response, works well for static resources like web pages, files, or application data.

However, consider a scenario where the **client doesn’t know when new information will become available.**

Let's think we are implementing a new feature for a newsletter website. We need this updates to happen in realtime. In this case, the client has no idea when the next update in the story is going to break.

Now, you _could_ code the client to make HTTP requests at a frequent interval just in case something happens and, for a handful of clients, that might work well enough.

But suppose you have hundreds or thousands of clients making requests to the server that yield nothing new between updates.

Not only is this a waste of bandwidth and server resources, but say the update breaks moments after the most recent request finished - it could be several seconds before the next request is sent and the user gets an update. This approach is called HTTP Polling and it's not as efficient as you can see.

There are other possibles solutions like HTTP Streaming, but all those have serious drawbacks to consider.
