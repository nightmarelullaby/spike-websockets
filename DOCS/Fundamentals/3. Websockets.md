### What are WebSockets?

Like HTTP, [WebSockets](https://ably.com/topic/websockets) is a communication protocol that enables clients  and servers to communicate with one another

Unlike HTTP with its request-response model, WebSockets are specifically designed to enable realtime bidirectional communication between the server and client. 

### What are they used for?

They are used to **create communication in realtime.** This means the server can push realtime updates as soon as they become available without waiting for the client to issue a request.

What’s more, WebSockets is a full-duplex protocol. 

In simple terms, this means data can flow in both directions over the same connection simultaneously, making WebSockets the go-to choice for applications where the client and server are equally “chatty” and require high throughput. We’re talking about things like chat, collaborative editing, and more.
