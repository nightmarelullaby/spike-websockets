In the backend, we listen to this event ``'client:join-room'``:

```
socket.on('client:join-room', async (data) => {
   if(socket.handshake.auth.token !== "123") return
	    let room = data.toString()
	    socket.join(room)
})
```

We get the data from client and convert it to string with ``toString()`` method. But before, you can see we validate something from socket headers.

If you remember, when we initialized our socket io instance we did this:

``` 
const [socket,setSocket] = useState( io(URL,{auth:{token},autoConnect: false}));
```

The object of the second parameter contains an auth prop with a token inside. So, we can pass any auth data to validate with backend. 

After that, we use ``socket.join`` method to join socket to specific room.

We can think in room as **places where only the users inside it can communicate each other.**
